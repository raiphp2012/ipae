  So smooth and responsive you won’t<BR> even notice it. And that’s the point.</h1>
  <p class="herotext">Because iOS is engineered specifically for iPhone and iPad, everything looks and feels incredibly fluid. iOS uses a framework called Metal to maximize graphics performance. Whether you’re surfing the web, moving from app to app, or playing the most complex 3D video game, the graphics and responsiveness are amazingly smooth. No other mobile operating system is so effortless and natural.

Apps can take full advantage of hardware features such as the powerful A10 chip, advanced camera system, Touch ID sensor, and 3D Touch.1 Your iPad lets you work with two apps at once. iOS even helps your battery last longer by updating apps only when your device is plugged in.

  Apps as elegant as they are essential.</h1>
  <p class="herotext">iOS comes with a core collection of Apple-designed apps you’ll use every day, like Photos, Maps, Messages, News, Health, and more. Each of these apps is engineered with incredible attention to detail. So, for example, when you send a message, you can express yourself in more ways than ever. Our apps also work with other apps, so you can book a table at a restaurant and a ride to get you there — without ever leaving Maps.

 Privacy and security are at the<BR> core of everything we believe. And everything we make.</h1>
  <p class="herotext">At Apple, protecting your information is something we build into our processes from the beginning.

If an app wants your location information or personal data — like in Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, or Photos — it needs your permission. And you have complete control over how apps access your HealthKit and HomeKit data. Conversations over iMessage and FaceTime are encrypted so no one but you and the person you’re talking to can see or read what’s being said while you’re communicating. And features built into Safari give you the ability to browse privately, block cookies, and prevent websites from tracking you.</p>

For starters, hardware and firmware features are designed to protect against malware and viruses, while iOS features help to secure your personal information. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as an easy alternative to entering your passcode each time, preventing unauthorized access to your device. And we give developers tools to make the safest apps possible, including top-notch encryption, app transport security, and more. The point is, security runs throughout the entire system — everything from the hardware to iOS to the App Store.</p>
